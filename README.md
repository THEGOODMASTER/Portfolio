# 1. INTEGRATING LANGUAGES PROJECT
This project was designed to take advantage of the strengths of both C++ and Python.

I feel that this project demonstrates industry standard inline comments superbly.

I know that to improve the efficiency of this program I could add a for loop to print the output rather than explicitly printing repeatedly.

The most challenging portion was getting the C++ function I added to work with the Python code. I was super glad to have the assistance of a fellow classmate with this one.

The skill of programming in multiple languages and knowing how to utilize the strengths of each is of invaluable measure. Before this course I had never programmed using Visual Studio and there are many little capabilities that it enables me to do that I know I'll use throughout my career. I know I will carry these experiences with me for the rest of my life.

I know the naming conventions and styling in this program contribute to the overall maintainability, readability, and adaptability, as well as the commenting and individual files each with their own purpose. 

# 2. SOFTWARE DESIGN DOCUMENT
#### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
This document lays out the design for the client "The Game Room" who is trying to design a web-based gaming application. In this design I considered both the client and server sides to the entire application. 

#### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
One of my greatest achievements in this document is the 'Evaluation' and the 'Recommendations' sections. I feel I was able to do sufficient research and make well educated claims specifically to these sections. 

#### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working to create a design document while simultaneously building the software, gave me insights into the design I might not have otherwise thought about. 

#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The section titled 'Design Constraints' could use some grammar editing. I feel that what I have there now does my ability some injustice in answering that type of question.

#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I knew from our prompts that this was a small startup, just beginning their journey in this project, and with little funding or support, so that was one of the many caveats I included throughout this document. When designing software you must consider the client’s needs and constraints just as you would when constructing a building. If you don't, you will face dire consequences.

#### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
One of the first things was I worked to consider their needs. What is their end goal with the project? What do they need to do to meet that goal? Next, I worked to consider the clients contraints. Are they on a tight budget? How big is their team? From there I considered a few options for the future design. What is even possible with this idea? How could we make it work? Finally, I summed up the document with some recommendations for growth in the project. What are things to keep in mind as we work on this project and how does our current stage affect the future?

# 3. SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN DOCUMENTS
#### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client for the project was a group of entrepreneurs with the idea to improve driving test pass rates. They would do it by providing study matierials and hands on experience. My job was to design the system that could enable them to operate.

#### What did you do particularly well?
From these two documents I felt that I broke down the needs of the company into reasonable tasks. It was quite the adventure to take the broad needs of a company and break it down to the object level.

#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think the activity diagram for the login system should have had explicit labeling that it will loop to receive input only a limited number of times. That is what I inteded for the system but I should have included it in the diagram.

#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The client wanted a secure system that they could be accessed by the general public as well as staff. Each of these users would have their own set of privilages so that the system can remain secure and still be updated and maintained. I gathered these requirements through a series of interviews with the client. Considering what is needed for the system and how each user of the system will use it is the best way to cover all bases in a design. It gives you a broader view of truly everything needed. 

#### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software I have taken the approach of reading or listening to the requirements given to me but only half hartedly. I wouldn't think beyond the bare requirements and it would cause me a lot of issues when it came time to actually code. From now on I will view the information I am given about a system in a very different light. I wouldn't expect that all issues I will encounter will have been accounted for.

# 4. Sprint Review and Retrospective

In order to start a project, it's imperative that requirements are accurately gathered. One of the most effective ways to talk with members of the various classes of users of the system. As they describe things that they would like to see in the system, you write them down, and then later break them up into tasks. Each of these tasks are called user stories and should be small enough to finish in the period allotted for one scrum. During this scrum we progress through one stage of the SDLC at a time. Once we get to the development stage, we start actually programming. During this stage I like to look at the different diagrams that have been previously developed. I would also revisit the requirements I have with the client to be sure that it's correct. Any discrepancies or changes are then fixed within documentation. It is at this point that I finally begin coding. Of course, none of this could get done effectively without a team. It is the team that makes these efforts so much easier, and quicker. Just being able to complete the tasks associated with your assigned role, and frequently communicating with others can make you one of the best on the team.
