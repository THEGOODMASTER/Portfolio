# 1. INTEGRATING LANGUAGES PROJECT
This project was designed to take advantage of the strengths of both C++ and Python.

I feel that this project demonstrates industry standard inline comments superbly.

I know that to improve the efficiency of this program I could add a for loop to print the output rather than explicitly printing repeatedly.

The most challenging portion was getting the C++ function I added to work with the Python code. I was super glad to have the assistance of a fellow classmate with this one.

The skill of programming in multiple languages and knowing how to utilize the strengths of each is of invaluable measure. Before this course I had never programmed using Visual Studio and there are many little capabilities that it enables me to do that I know I'll use throughout my career. I know I will carry these experiences with me for the rest of my life.

I know the naming conventions and styling in this program contribute to the overall maintainability, readability, and adaptability, as well as the commenting and individual files each with their own purpose. 

# 2. SOFTWARE DESIGN DOCUMENT
#### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
This document lays out the design for the client "The Game Room" who is trying to design a web-based gaming application. In this design I considered both the client and server sides to the entire application. 

#### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
One of my greatest achievements in this document is the 'Evaluation' and the 'Recommendations' sections. I feel I was able to do sufficient research and make well educated claims specifically to these sections. 

#### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working to create a design document while simultaneously building the software, gave me insights into the design I might not have otherwise thought about. 

#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The section titled 'Design Constraints' could use some grammar editing. I feel that what I have there now does my ability some injustice in answering that type of question.

#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I knew from our prompts that this was a small startup, just beginning their journey in this project, and with little funding or support, so that was one of the many caveats I included throughout this document. When designing software you must consider the client’s needs and constraints just as you would when constructing a building. If you don't, you will face dire consequences.

#### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
One of the first things was I worked to consider their needs. What is their end goal with the project? What do they need to do to meet that goal? Next, I worked to consider the clients contraints. Are they on a tight budget? How big is their team? From there I considered a few options for the future design. What is even possible with this idea? How could we make it work? Finally, I summed up the document with some recommendations for growth in the project. What are things to keep in mind as we work on this project and how does our current stage affect the future?

# 3. SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN DOCUMENTS
#### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client for the project was a group of entrepreneurs with the idea to improve driving test pass rates. They would do it by providing study matierials and hands on experience. My job was to design the system that could enable them to operate.

#### What did you do particularly well?
From these two documents I felt that I broke down the needs of the company into reasonable tasks. It was quite the adventure to take the broad needs of a company and break it down to the object level.

#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think the activity diagram for the login system should have had explicit labeling that it will loop to receive input only a limited number of times. That is what I inteded for the system but I should have included it in the diagram.

#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The client wanted a secure system that they could be accessed by the general public as well as staff. Each of these users would have their own set of privilages so that the system can remain secure and still be updated and maintained. I gathered these requirements through a series of interviews with the client. Considering what is needed for the system and how each user of the system will use it is the best way to cover all bases in a design. It gives you a broader view of truly everything needed. 

#### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software I have taken the approach of reading or listening to the requirements given to me but only half hartedly. I wouldn't think beyond the bare requirements and it would cause me a lot of issues when it came time to actually code. From now on I will view the information I am given about a system in a very different light. I wouldn't expect that all issues I will encounter will have been accounted for.

# 4. Sprint Review and Retrospective

In order to start a project, it's imperative that requirements are accurately gathered. One of the most effective ways is to talk with members of the various classes of users of the system. As they describe things that they would like to see in the system, you write them down, and then later break them up into tasks. Each of these tasks are called user stories and should be small enough to finish in the period allotted for one scrum. During this scrum we progress through one stage of the SDLC at a time. Once we get to the development stage, we start actually programming. During this stage I like to look at the different diagrams that have been previously developed. I would also revisit the requirements I have with the client to be sure that it's correct. Any discrepancies or changes are then fixed within documentation. It is at this point that I finally begin coding. Of course, none of this could get done effectively without a team. It is the team that makes these efforts so much easier, and quicker. Just being able to complete the tasks associated with your assigned role, and frequently communicating with others can make you one of the best on the team.

One of the best methods to ensuring your code, program, or software is functional and secure is through automated tests. In order to interpret user needs and incorporate them in a program, it's imperative that requirements are accurately gathered.

# 6. CS 305 Project 1

Artemis Financial is a financial firm that was looking to secure their communications and data. After identifying currently existing vulnerabilities from the dependencies, I resolved them by updating the dependencies to the most current version. I also read through the code to identify flaws that could render the software vulnerable. These should be standard practices for any company that desires to make security a priority. If there are flaws in the code or supporting software, this could potentially expose private data the company stores. If attacked, the company will be expected to pay to fix the damage, setting them back in their planned endeavors. I enjoyed using tools such as the open source maven vulnerability assessment tool and found it very helpful in identifying vulnerabilities. The tool automatically links you to identified vulnerabilities as found on the NIST database website. Beyond just identifying current vulnerabilities I worked to encrypt both the data to be transfered and the transfer system itself through SSL. If I was to conduct a similar project again in the future I would probably do it in a similar fashion. Using my coding experience and the vulnerability check tool, I made certain the code and software application were functional and secure even after I made the encryption upgrades. One resource I was introduced to that I will continue to use is the book, "DevSecOps: A Systemic Approach for Secure Software Development". I will also take the practices of secure coding with me as well. From this project I have demonstrated that I can take client needs and turn it into a working and highly improved product plan.

# 7. CS 360 

#### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
This app was designed to help users track their weight loss. This could feed ones motivation to press on despite the diffifulties of such a task.
#### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app requires you to login with your credentials and then takes you to the data display page. If the user is new, there is an option to register. The data page shows the date the weight was added, the weight in pounds that was submitted, and the inputed info can be updated should the user need to do so. By adding funcitonality that gives the user more control I kept the user in mind for my design. My designs were successful because the use for each element is clear, and it meets the users needs. 
#### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
When developing applications it's a good idea to have a detailed plan of what is needed and usually how you will fulfill that need.  I don't typically follow this in the school setting but I do for outside projects. Instead, I read and reread the provided requirements and try my best to fulfill to assignment requirements. I use many resources to help me through development because I typically don't know everything I need to know to develop the app. Documentation, as well as online videos, forums, and blogs are typically where I find the best assistance.
#### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I just did manual testing for this project and made sure that the functionality was as I intended and that it actually made sense in the end. When I was trying to figure out how I was going to make the content editable, I thought the best approach would be to have a single button to initiate the edit and to submit the change. After testing several different ways to get it to work I eventually found that the best approach was to have the user hold the item down to initiate, then have a new button appear to submit the change. Not only was this UI easier to code, but it looks awesome too! Testing is very important for this exact reason and more!
#### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The whole project required me to innovate at just about every step! Nothing went as I invisioned it and it was way harder to make it work than I anticipated. Including the above example, I also had to work through making the database connect and initiate a log in if the users info was verified. I have never done this before but I've written to and read from files so I thought it would be similar but it's really not. This required me to reinvent my original plan and innovate another approach.
#### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The fact that the language was Java, I was more comfortable with it I easily picked it up and figured out the new methods and their uses. I find that Java developers use some of the best naming conventions overall but of course I'm biased. Because of the way the packages flow, and the fact that you have to type all of them out to reach the method you want makes the naming more clear to me. This was a great demonstration of my knowledge, skills, and experience.

# 8. CS 340

As a computer scientist, writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs is essential. In developing the CRUD Python module for Project One and integrating it with the dashboard widgets for Project Two, I ensured that the code was well-structured, documented, and modular. This approach offered several advantages. Firstly, it simplified debugging and troubleshooting, as each function had a specific purpose and was easy to understand. Secondly, it facilitated future modifications and enhancements to the system, allowing for seamless updates as requirements evolved. Moving forward, the CRUD Python module could be repurposed for various applications beyond database connectivity, such as file management or API interactions, further maximizing its utility.

Approaching problems as a computer scientist involves systematic analysis, planning, and implementation. When addressing Grazioso Salvare's database and dashboard requirements, I followed a structured approach, starting with understanding the problem domain and defining clear objectives. This differed from previous assignments by emphasizing real-world application and client needs over purely technical challenges. In the future, I would leverage techniques like entity-relationship modeling and agile development methodologies to efficiently design and implement databases tailored to specific client requirements.

Computer scientists play a vital role in solving complex problems and advancing technology. By delivering high-quality software solutions, like the database and dashboard system for Grazioso Salvare, companies can streamline their operations, enhance decision-making processes, and ultimately improve their productivity and competitiveness. Our work on this project enabled Grazioso Salvare to manage their data more effectively, gain insights through intuitive visualizations, and make informed business decisions, thereby empowering them to achieve their objectives more efficiently.

# 9. CS 330

In approaching the design of software for my computational graphics and visualization project, I began by conceptualizing the desired outcome and breaking it down into manageable components. This involved considering the overall structure of the 3D scene, the objects to be included, and the visual effects to be implemented. Throughout the project, I honed my design skills by learning how to create realistic 3D worlds while maintaining an organized and modular codebase. My design process involved iterative development, starting with basic shapes and gradually adding complexity and detail. This approach allowed me to refine my understanding of OpenGL techniques and develop a deeper appreciation for the intricacies of computational graphics. In future work, I plan to apply these design tactics by approaching software development with a systematic and iterative mindset, breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable tasks.

In terms of developing programs, my work on the 3D scene project introduced me to new development strategies specific to graphics programming. I learned how to leverage OpenGL libraries effectively and implement features like lighting, shading, and texture mapping to enhance the visual quality of the scene. Iteration played a crucial role in my development process, as I continually refined and optimized my code based on feedback and experimentation. Throughout the milestones of the project, my approach to developing code evolved from a more exploratory phase to a more focused and goal-oriented phase, leading to the completion of the project. Looking ahead, I recognize the value of computer science in helping me reach my goals, both educationally and professionally. Computational graphics and visualizations have equipped me with valuable knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future educational pathway, such as pursuing advanced courses in graphics programming or computer science research. Additionally, these skills are highly transferable to my future professional pathway, as they are in high demand in industries such as game development, virtual reality, and data visualization. Overall, my experience in computational graphics and visualization has broadened my horizons and provided me with a solid foundation for future success in both academic and professional endeavors.
