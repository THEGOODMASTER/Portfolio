# 1. INTEGRATING LANGUAGES PROJECT
This project was designed to take advantage of the strengths of both C++ and Python.

I feel that this project demonstrates industry standard inline comments superbly.

I know that to improve the efficiency of this program I could add a for loop to print the output rather than explicitly printing repeatedly.

The most challanging portion was getting the C++ function I added to work with the Python code. I was super glad to have the assistance of a fellow class mate with this one.

The skill of programming in multiple languages and knowing how to utilize the strengths of each is of invaluable measure. Before this course I had never programmed using Visual Studio and there are many little capabilities that it enables me to do that I know I'll use throughout my career. I know I will carry these experiences with me for the rest of my life.

I know the naming conventions and styling in this program contribute to the overall  maintainability, readability, and adaptability, as well as the commenting and individual files each with their own purpose. 

# 2. SOFTWARE DESIGN DOCUMENT
#### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
This document lays out the design for the client "The Game Room" who is trying to design a web based gaming application. In this design I considered both the client and server sides to the entire application. 

#### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
One of my greatest achivements in this document is the 'Evaluation' and the 'Recommendations' sections. I feel I was able to do sufficient research and make well educated claims specifically to these sections. 

#### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working to create a design document while simultaniously building the software, gave me insights into the design I might not have otherwise thought about. 

#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The section titled 'Design Constraints' could use some grammer editing. I feel that what I have there at the moment does my ability some injustice in answering that type of question.

#### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I knew from our prompts that this was a small start up, just beginning their journey in this project, and with little funding or support, so that was one of the many caveats I included throughout this document. When designing software you must consider the clients needs and constraints just as you would when constructing a building. If you don't, you will face dire concequences.

#### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
One of the first things was I worked to consider their needs. What is their end goal with the project? What do they need to do to meet that goal? Next, I worked to consider the clients contraints. Are they on a tight budget? How big is their team? From there I considered a few options for the future design. What is even possible with this idea? How could we make it work? Finally, I summed up the document with some recommendations for growth in the project. What are things to keep in mind as we work on this project and how does our current stage affect the future?
