# 1. INTEGRATING LANGUAGES PROJECT
This project was designed to take advantage of the strengths of both C++ and Python.

I feel that this project demonstrates industry standard inline comments superbly.

I know that to improve the efficiency of this program I could add a for loop to print the output rather than explicitly printing repeatedly.

The most challanging portion was getting the C++ function I added to work with the Python code. I was super glad to have the assistance of a fellow class mate with this one.

The skill of programming in multiple languages and knowing how to utilize the strengths of each is of invaluable measure. Before this course I had never programmed using Visual Studio and there are many little capabilities that it enables me to do that I know I'll use throughout my career. I know I will carry these experiences with me for the rest of my life.

I know the naming conventions and styling in this program contribute to the overall  maintainability, readability, and adaptability, as well as the commenting and individual files each with their own purpose.
